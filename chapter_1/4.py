Assignment
Simple addition is used all the time in game development. In Fantasy Quest, we want weapons to deal bonus damage when they're enchanted.

Our hero's sword deals 250 damage normally, but should deal an additional 75 damage when it's enchanted.

Calculate and print the result of 250 + 75
"""

normal_damage = 250

enchanted_damage = 75

total_damage = normal_damage + enchanted_damage

print(total_damage)
