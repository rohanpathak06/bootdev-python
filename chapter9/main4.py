"""Assignment
Fantasy Quest is trialing a new inventory system for their hardcore game mode. If a player has Iron Ore or an Iron Bar, it is always stored in the 2nd inventory slot (and they can only have one or the other).

Let's finish the smelt_ore function:

Check if they have Iron Ore in the second inventory slot.
If they do, change it into an Iron Bar."""

def smelt_ore(inventory):
    
    if inventory[1] == "Iron Ore":
        inventory[1] = "Iron Bar"

    return inventory
