"""Assignment
Some of our players would like to view their inventories in reverse order.

Let's write a function that takes a list as an input and returns a new list except all the items are in reverse order.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] -> [3, 2, 1]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] -> ['d', 'c', 'b', 'a']"""


def reverse_list(items):
    empty = []
    for i in range(len(items) - 1, -1 , -1):
        empty.append(items[i])
        
    return empty
