"""Assignment
Some of our player's inventories are huge, so looking through the entire list is cumbersome. Let's find an easy way for us to get the index of the last item in their inventory.

Complete the get_last_index function so that it returns the length of the inventory list minus 1."""

    last_item = len(inventory) - 1
