"""Assignment
The Fantasy Quest character system needs a list of "heroes" to be able to run the game properly. Someone wrote some pretty nasty code, and the code in question creates a heroes list where every 3rd index defines a new hero. First their name, then their age, then whether or not they're an "elf".

Restructure the heroes list into a list of tuples by editing the syntax on lines 3 through 14, where each tuple represents one hero and contains their data in the same order."""
