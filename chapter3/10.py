"""Assignment
Complete the curse function. It accepts a weapon_damage parameter and returns two values:

The lesser_cursed damage: reduce the input weapon_damage from 100% to 50% (50% reduction).
The greater_cursed damage: reduce the input weapon_damage from 100% to 25% (75% reduction).
A greater curse is more powerful than a lesser curse, so it reduces the damage more."""
