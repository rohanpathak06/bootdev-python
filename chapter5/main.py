"""Assignment
Complete the total_xp function. It accepts two integers as input:

level
xp_to_add
There are 100 xp per level. total_xp should convert the current level to xp, then add this current xp to the xp_to_add argument and return the player's total xp. For example:

If a player is level 1 and gains 100 xp, they have 200 total xp.
If a player is level 2 and gains 250 xp, they have 450 total xp.
If a player is level 170 and gains 590 xp, they have 17590 total xp."""

def total_xp(level, xp_to_add):
    level_to_xp = level * 100
    added_xp = level_to_xp + xp_to_add
    return added_xp
