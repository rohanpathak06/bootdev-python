"""Assignment
We need a way for our game to track whether a character's attack hits or misses.

Complete the does_attack_hit function. The function should return True if either of the following conditions are met:

The attack_roll is not a 1 and the attack roll is greater than or equal to the armor_class, or
The attack roll is a 20
Otherwise, it should return False.
