"""Assignment
Due to the constraints of our app's server, there is a maximum number of players we can have on a single Fantasy Quest server.

Complete the max_players_on_server function. It takes no inputs, but simply returns 3 static numbers:

The max players on a "small" server: 1,024,000,000,000,000,000 (1.024e18)
The max players on a "medium" server: 10,240,000,000,000,000,000
The max players on a "large" server: 102,400,000,000,000,000,000
Use scientific notation to represent these numbers. For example: 3.104e15."""
