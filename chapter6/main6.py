"""Assignment
Complete the calculate_guild_perms function. It takes as input four binary numbers representing the separate permissions of each member of the guild: glorfindel, galadriel, elendil and elrond. It should return a single binary number that represents the combined permissions of all the members of the guild.

Use a series of bitwise "or" operations to calculate the superset of all the member's permissions."""
